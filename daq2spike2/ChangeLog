	* Lots of files: add in gpl & licensing info to play nice with github.

2019-12-02  dshuman@usf.edu

	* configure.ac: Remove check for mxe cross dev, only edt2spike2 needed ti.
	* configure.ac: Bump to 1.0.9. 

2019-11-27  dshuman@usf.edu

	* Makefile.am: Move edt2spike2 to usfsim. Makes more sense to package it
	with sim stuff.

2019-11-26  dshuman@usf.edu

	* Makefile.am: Mod to create a statically linked Win version of edt2spike2
	so users don't have to deal with a .dll library file. Also, when checking
	for libson64, added found action. If the yes field is blank, it adds
	-lson64 to all of the targets, only a couple need it, and on Debian, even
	if the target does not need the lib, the linker complains that it cannot
	find pthread refs. Not on Ubuntun? Different tool versions?
	* configure.ac: Bump to 1.0.8.
	* Makefile.am: Discover I really do need to package son64 in its own
	package because usfsim also needs it, and I can't just refer to some stuff
	outside of the source tree to build the package. Make it so.

2019-08-02  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cyg2daq.cpp: Add in check for zero sample value and force it to one. Zero
	is forbidden value.
	* configure.ac: Bump to 1.0.6.
	* cyg2daq.cpp: The zero fix was wrong, maybe it is correct now.
	* configure.ac: Bump to 1.0.7.

	* daq2spike2.cpp: add in file permission settings like in edt2spike2.cpp.

2019-06-11  dale@health.usf.edu

	* daq2spike2.cpp: Cygnus tape and datamax recordings do not have 65-128
	files, so make these optional.
	* configure.ac: bump to 1.0.4 ahead of release.

2019-05-21  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cyg2daq.cpp: add to package.
	* configure.ac: bump to 1.0.3.

	change.
